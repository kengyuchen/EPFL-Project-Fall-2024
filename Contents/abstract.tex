In this project, we focus on the cryptographic layer for biometric authentication. The layer is added on the top of authentication scheme for privacy reasons. We first formalize a biometric authentication scheme and propose security models for two security properties of interest: \emph{unforgeability} and \emph{indistinguishability}. Unforgeability refers to an adversary's ability to impersonate a user, while indistinguishability evaluates the server's knowledge of users' biometrics, related to privacy preservation. Subsequently, we analyze two existing instantiations of biometric authentication built on two cryptographic primitives: function-hiding inner product functional encryption and relational hash. Our results demonstrate conditions under which these schemes achieve security within our security model, and we propose a simple way to strengthen the system based on functional encryption by adding a digital signature in the cryptographic layer.
