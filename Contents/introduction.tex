Biometric authentication offers an error-tolerant approach to user verification. Despite its convenience, unlike traditional authentication methods, servers have to verify users' identities by comparing the similarity of enrolled and probed data instead of their equivalence. An authentication method based on comparing hashes of two templates thus fails. Additionally, unlike a user-defined password, biometrics reveal sensitive personal information and cannot be changed, raising significant privacy concerns. Furthermore, the inherent nature of biometrics data can introduce a non-negligible false positive rate. These issues make designing a biometric authentication scheme and analyzing its security challenging and highlight the importance of a rigorous study in this domain.
